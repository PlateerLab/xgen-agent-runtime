"""Generalized, app-neutral sub-agent / sub-worker type catalog.

xgen-agent-runtime ships a small set of GENERALIZED sub-agent types — ``worker``,
``researcher``, ``summarizer``, ``critic`` — as plain specifications
(:class:`SubagentTypeSpec`): an ``agent_type``, a human description, an
``allowed_tools`` shape, and a strong default ``system_prompt``. These are
deliberately app-neutral; nothing here knows about any particular product.

A host turns a spec into a runnable
:class:`~xgen_agent_runtime.stages.s12_agent.subagent_type.SubagentTypeDescriptor`
by attaching its own pipeline factory (the library does not prescribe how a
host builds pipelines) — see :func:`specs_to_descriptors`. Hosts are expected
to subset / override / extend the catalog freely.

:data:`DEFAULT_PERSISTENT_SUBAGENT_PROMPT` is the strong default persona for an
owned, long-lived *companion* sub-agent when the host pins no custom role.
