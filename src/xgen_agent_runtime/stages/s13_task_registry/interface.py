"""Stage 13: Task Registry — interface definitions (S9b.2).

The registry stores :class:`TaskRecord` instances; the policy decides
what the stage *does* with newly registered tasks (block until they
finish, fire-and-forget, time-bounded wait, etc.).

Both abstractions are :class:`Strategy` subclasses so they fit into
the existing slot machinery and can be swapped at runtime.
