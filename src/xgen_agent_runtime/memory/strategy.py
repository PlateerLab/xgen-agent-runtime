"""``ProviderDrivenStrategy`` — provider-driven Stage 18 strategy.

Replaces the legacy ``GenyMemoryStrategy`` (host-manager duck-type)
with a generic implementation that talks to a ``MemoryProvider``
directly. The strategy is intentionally minimal — it only wires
``provider.record_turn`` for newly-appended messages. Heavy lifting
(record_execution / reflect / promote) is handled by ``MemoryStage``
itself (see ``stages/s18_memory/artifact/default/stage.py``); the
strategy's job is to make sure every user/assistant message lands in
STM via the provider before that stage's terminal logic runs.

The legacy ``GenyMemoryStrategy`` and its ``ReflectionResolver``
helper are deleted in this cycle (D5 — "즉시 폐기"). Hosts that need
custom reflection plumbing should implement a callback through
``MemoryHooks.should_reflect`` + ``state.metadata['needs_reflection']``
and run their own reflection job out-of-band, OR use the executor's
native reflection path via the ``MemoryStage`` provider hooks.

    For every newly-appended message in ``state.messages`` since the

    This is a thin wrapper because ``MemoryStage._drive_provider``
    already handles the same duty when ``provider`` is attached to
    the stage; ``ProviderDrivenStrategy`` exists so the strategy slot
    of ``MemoryStage`` is non-empty even when the host wants the

    provider attached, the legacy ``AppendOnlyStrategy`` /
    ``ReflectiveStrategy`` paths can stay unused.
