"""C2 — Execution-end recording.

Acceptance (`docs/MEMORY_SPEC.yaml::completeness_criteria[1]`):
On terminal state, `record_execution(...)` writes a dated LTM entry,
creates a structured note, and incrementally indexes new content
into the vector layer (when present). Emits `memory.execution_recorded`
with non-zero counts.

The activation exercises every registered provider. Event emission
itself is a stage-level concern (MemoryEvent.EXECUTION_RECORDED is the
payload the stage would then dispatch); this test pins the
provider-side contract — the shape of `RecordReceipt` the event
carries.
