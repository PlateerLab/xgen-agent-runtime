"""C7 — Adapter parity.

Acceptance (`docs/MEMORY_SPEC.yaml::completeness_criteria[6]`):
Running the same scenario through `GenyManagerAdapter` (reference
fixture) and through the native `FileMemoryProvider` yields
semantically equivalent outputs: identical chunk composition (modulo
float tolerance), identical note set, identical link graph, identical
vector top-k for each probe query.

This is the **G3 gate** test. When green, executor v1.0.0-rc is
declared complete. The adapter is then quarantined as a test fixture
and excluded from the runtime artifact.

State: **red** until Phase 3.
