"""C3 — LLM reflection and auto-promotion.

Acceptance (`docs/MEMORY_SPEC.yaml::completeness_criteria[2]`):
`reflect(...)` yields Insights of (title, content, category, tags,
importance). High/critical Insights auto-promote to curated scope via
`promote(...)`. Each promotion emits `memory.promoted`.

Native providers keep `reflect()` passive — insights come from a stage
wiring in an LLM callable via `MemoryHooks`. The C3 activation pins
the parts the provider *does* own: the `Insight.should_auto_promote`
gate plus the `promote()` machinery that moves a SESSION-scoped note
into USER scope. A stage wrapping these calls is what emits
`memory.promoted`; the event payload is the returned NoteRef, which
this test asserts is correctly re-scoped.
