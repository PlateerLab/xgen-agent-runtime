"""Shared manifest stage-entry helpers for tests.

2.2.0 strict ``Pipeline.from_manifest`` enforces the required-stage
contract (``introspection._STAGE_REQUIRED``): ``s01_input`` /
``s06_api`` / ``s09_parse`` / ``s21_yield`` must be present and active,
because a pipeline without input/api/parse/yield is not an agent loop
(audit 2026-06-09 §1-2 — strict mode used to happily build "pipelines"
with no LLM call in them).

Many older test manifests were minimal on purpose (``stages=[]`` for
tool-registration tests, a lone Stage-6 entry for provider-location
tests). Those fixtures now compose this helper so the *subject under
test* stays the same while the manifest meets the structural contract
every real manifest has to meet anyway.
