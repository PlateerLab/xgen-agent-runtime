"""2.2.0 Wave 2 — ``HostSelections.resolve`` contract tests.

Audit §3.5 flagged ``HostSelections.resolve`` as a decoy: zero library
call sites while the class docstring claimed the runtime intersected
selections at session boot. The 2.2.0 resolution is honesty, not
wiring: the docstring now states that *hosts* apply selections (the
name/id schemes belong to host registries — e.g. Geny's permission ids
are minted in ``service/permission/install.py``), and ``resolve`` is
the supported helper for that filtering. These tests pin the helper's
contract so host implementations (Geny mirrors the semantics) have a
library-side source of truth.
