"""Cancellation & consumer-abandonment suite (2.2.0 wave 3).

Audit 2026-06-09 §3.7: "cancellation 테스트 0 (run_stream 소비자 이탈,
CLI subprocess 고아화) — 두 host 모두 SSE 서버라 client disconnect 가
일상". Both hosts stream pipeline events over SSE, so a browser tab
closing mid-answer is the NORMAL ending of a run, not an edge case —
yet nothing pinned what the engine does when the consumer walks away.

This module pins the pipeline half of that contract (the CLI
subprocess half lives in ``tests/llm_client/unit/test_cli_cancellation.py``):

  * run_stream abandonment — the background run task keeps executing
    to completion (documented run-to-completion semantics), the
    ``_runs_in_flight`` counter drains back to 0, the journal/taps
    record the terminal event nobody watched, and nothing trickles
    out after completion.
  * events() tap closed mid-stream — queue detaches, no leaked tasks,
    the journal keeps recording for the next subscriber.
  * run() task cancelled mid-turn — the run-in-progress lock releases
    and the pipeline accepts the next turn.
