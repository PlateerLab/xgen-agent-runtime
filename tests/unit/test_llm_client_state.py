"""Tests for state.llm_client slot and Pipeline.attach_runtime wiring.

After Phase A3, state.llm_client is sourced from one of two places:
  1. ``Pipeline.attach_runtime(llm_client=...)`` (host-supplied client)
  2. ``Pipeline.from_manifest_async(credentials=...)`` resolving Stage 6's
     ``config["provider"]`` through ``ClientRegistry`` + ``CredentialBundle``

Manifest-driven resolution is exercised by the conformance harness; this
file focuses on the attach_runtime + fresh-state contract.
