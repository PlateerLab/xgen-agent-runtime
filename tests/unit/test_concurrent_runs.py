"""Concurrent run_stream calls on ONE pipeline — the never-reproduced case.

Audit 2026-06-09 completeness gap: overlapping runs on a shared
pipeline were reasoned about (the wave-2 run_id filter, the counter
semantics of ``_runs_in_flight``) but never actually reproduced in the
suite. Both hosts can hit this shape — GAPT keeps one pipeline per
workspace and a second SSE request can land while the first turn still
streams.

Pinned here, with two concurrent ``run_stream`` calls on one pipeline
and two separate states:

  (a) run_id-filtered streams don't cross-leak events — each consumer
      sees only its own run's traffic (the wave-2 collector filter);
  (b) both runs complete, each with its own text and its own state;
  (c) the pipeline-scoped ``events()`` tap sees BOTH run_ids (it is
      the cross-run observer; ``run_stream`` is the per-run one);
  (d) the in-flight counter brackets the overlap correctly and drains
      to 0.
