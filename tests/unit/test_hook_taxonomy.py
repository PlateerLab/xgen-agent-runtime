"""2.2.0 hook taxonomy honesty tests (audit 2026-06-09 §3.5).

``FIRED_EVENTS`` must track what the engine actually emits — the enum
advertising 16 kinds while ~3 fired cost both hosts dead-handler
debugging time. The grep-driven test below fails the build whenever a
fire-site ships without updating the set (or the set claims an event
nobody fires).
