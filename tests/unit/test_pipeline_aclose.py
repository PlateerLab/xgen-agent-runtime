"""``Pipeline.aclose()`` / ``close()`` teardown tests (2.2.0, audit §2.4).

The library never owned teardown before 2.2.0 — ``disconnect_all`` had
exactly one caller (the build-failure unwind inside
``from_manifest_async``), so hosts stopping a session with declared
``mcp_servers`` orphaned stdio MCP child processes (live Geny prod
leak). ``aclose()`` is the aggregation point; these tests pin its
contract: full aggregation, idempotency, and safety on pipelines whose
construction never attached anything.
