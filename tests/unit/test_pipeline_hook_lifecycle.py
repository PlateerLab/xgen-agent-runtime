"""Pipeline-fired lifecycle hooks (2.2.0, audit §3.5 dead-handler fix).

``HookEvent`` advertised pipeline start/end, stage enter/exit and
loop-iteration-end for two releases while no engine path fired them —
hosts bound dead handlers. The pipeline now mirrors its bus events to
an attached hook runner. These tests pin: the five kinds fire with the
right payload shape, nothing fires without a runner, and a broken
handler cannot break the run.
