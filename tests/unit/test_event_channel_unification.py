"""2.2.0 event-channel unification (audit 2026-06-09 §3.2).

Pre-2.2.0 the engine ran two disjoint event worlds: the EventBus
(stage transitions, ``pipeline.on()``) and ``state.add_event`` (text
deltas, api telemetry) — bus subscribers could never see the state
channel, and ``run_stream`` merged the two with a pair of collectors.
These tests pin the unified model: state events forward into the bus,
``run_stream`` subscribes exactly once, and nothing is duplicated or
reordered.
