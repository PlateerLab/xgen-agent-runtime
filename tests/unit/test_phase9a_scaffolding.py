"""Tests for Sub-phase 9a scaffolding stages.

Originally all five stages were pure pass-throughs. Sub-phase 9b
promotes them one at a time:

  * S9b.1 — tool_review (chain of reviewers)
  * S9b.2 — task_registry (registry + policy slots)
  * S9b.3+ — hitl / summarize / persist still pass-through-ish

The metadata + ``execute`` round-trip checks below skip the stages
that have been promoted (they have their own dedicated tests).
