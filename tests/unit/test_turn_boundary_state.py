"""Turn-boundary contract on reused state (2.2.0, audit §3.3).

The long-lived-state model (GAPT) reuses one ``PipelineState`` across
turns. Before 2.2.0 nothing reset the per-turn fields, so a reused
state carried ``loop_decision="error"`` into the next turn's success
verdict, climbed ``iteration`` toward MAX_ITERATIONS across turns, and
grew ``events`` without bound — while the state docstring *claimed* a
reset that didn't exist. These tests pin:

* ``begin_turn()`` resets exactly the per-turn class;
* ``run()`` applies it automatically for reused states (run-count
  marker OR pre-seeded messages, i.e. checkpoint rehydration);
* cost split — ``total_cost_usd`` per-turn (budget guards), folded
  into session-cumulative ``session_cost_usd`` at turn end;
* sticky-client symmetry — ``invalidate_client()`` + the generation
  counter make rotation land on reused states;
* ``state=None`` loudness + ``PipelineResult.state`` recovery.
