"""Regression: embedding clients must be loop-safe.

An httpx-backed SDK client (AsyncOpenAI / genai.Client) binds its transport
to the event loop that first drives it and cannot be reused from another
loop. Hosts that drive memory writes through a sync->async bridge spin a
fresh event loop PER CALL, so a naively-cached client (a) fails cross-loop
on every bridged embed with "Event loop is closed" and (b), never being
closed, leaks its socket pool once per session.

``_LoopBoundClientMixin`` fixes this: it caches one client on the stable
loop (pooled/reused), hands any other live loop a short-lived client it
closes within the call, and drops a dead-loop cache so an all-bridge caller
never accumulates references. These tests pin that behaviour without needing
the real SDKs or a network — a fake SDK client asserts it is only ever
driven on the loop it was built on.
