"""PipelineEvent correlation fields — session_id / run_id / seq (2.2.0).

Audit 2026-06-09 §3.2: hosts running several sessions in one process
had no way to attribute an event to its conversation; Geny wrapped
every collector in closure-captured session ids. The engine now stamps
correlation on every event it publishes, on both channels.
