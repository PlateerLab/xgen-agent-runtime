"""A dead CLI must not be able to park a turn on its own stdout.

Production, 2026-08-10. Turns stopped answering. The stack said the
pipeline was inside ``_call_streaming``, awaiting the client's async
generator; the CLI trace said the very same invocation had exited
``rc=0`` with a complete answer, seconds in. Both were true.

A pipe reaches EOF when the LAST writer closes it, and the CLI is not
the only writer: it spawns MCP servers as children and they inherit its
stdout. One that outlives it — a bridge that misses the parent-death
signal, a server mid-request — holds the write end open, and
``readline()`` blocks on a pipe with nothing left to write to it. The
reader waited for EOF, so it waited for the full ``timeout_s``: 30
minutes of spinner over an answer that was already complete.

The fix reaps the child concurrently and, once it is gone, gives stdout
only ``exit_drain_grace_s`` to produce anything more. Buffered bytes
still arrive — draining a buffer is instant next to that grace.

``leaky_child_then_exit`` reproduces the shape exactly: full stream-json
answer, clean exit, one forked child sitting on the inherited FD.
